## **Prerequisites**

Before integrating **Fossil Sanity** into your project, ensure the following:

- **Meson Build System**: Fossil Sanity leverages Meson for configuration. Follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) if you donâ€™t already have it installed.

---

### **Adding Fossil Sanity to Your Project**

1. **Install Meson**  
   Install or upgrade Meson (version `1.3` or newer):

   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # Install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # Upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Add a `.wrap` File**  
   Create a `fossil-sanity.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory:

   ```ini
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-sanity.git
   revision = v0.1.0

   [provide]
   fossil-sanity = fossil_sanity_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the Dependency**  
   Add the following to your `meson.build` file to include Fossil Sanity:

   ```meson
   dep = dependency('fossil-sanity')
   ```

---

### **Example: Setting Up and Parsing Commands**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "fossil/sanity/framework.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Step 1: Create a parser palette
    fossil_sanity_parser_palette_t *palette = fossil_sanity_parser_create_palette(
        "MyTool Palette", 
        "A palette for parsing MyTool commands."
    );

    // Step 2: Add a command
    fossil_sanity_parser_command_t *add_command = fossil_sanity_parser_add_command(
        palette, 
        "add", 
        "Adds a new item to the list."
    );

    // Step 3: Add arguments to the 'add' command
    fossil_sanity_parser_add_argument(add_command, "name", FOSSIL_SANITY_PARSER_STRING, NULL, 0);
    fossil_sanity_parser_add_argument(add_command, "priority", FOSSIL_SANITY_PARSER_COMBO, 
        (char *[]){"high", "medium", "low"}, 3);
    fossil_sanity_parser_add_argument(add_command, "urgent", FOSSIL_SANITY_PARSER_BOOL, NULL, 0);

    // Step 4: Add another command
    fossil_sanity_parser_command_t *list_command = fossil_sanity_parser_add_command(
        palette, 
        "list", 
        "Lists all items."
    );

    // Step 5: Parse command-line arguments
    fossil_sanity_parser_parse(palette, argc, argv);

    // Step 6: Free the parser palette
    fossil_sanity_parser_free(palette);

    return 0;
}
```
