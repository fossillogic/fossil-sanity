## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

To use **Fossil Sanity**, ensure the following:  
- **Meson Build System**: Required for configuring and integrating Fossil Sanity. Install it from the [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Install Meson**  
   Install or upgrade Meson to version `1.3` or newer:

   ```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # Install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # Upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Add the Library**  
   Create a `.wrap` file in your `subprojects` directory:

   ```ini
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-sanity.git
   revision = v0.1.1

   [provide]
   fossil-sanity = fossil_sanity_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the Dependency**  
   Add the following to your `meson.build` file:

   ```meson
   dep = dependency('fossil-sanity')
   ```

## **Example: Building a CLI with Validation and Logging**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "fossil/sanity/framework.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Initialize a CLI parser
    fossil_sanity_parser_palette_t *palette = fossil_sanity_parser_create_palette(
        "ExampleApp", 
        "Command-line interface for ExampleApp."
    );

    // Add commands and arguments
    fossil_sanity_parser_command_t *add_command = fossil_sanity_parser_add_command(
        palette, 
        "add", 
        "Adds an item."
    );
    fossil_sanity_parser_add_argument(add_command, "name", FOSSIL_SANITY_PARSER_STRING, NULL, 0);
    fossil_sanity_parser_add_argument(add_command, "priority", FOSSIL_SANITY_PARSER_COMBO, 
        (char *[]){"high", "medium", "low"}, 3);

    // Parse user input
    fossil_sanity_parser_parse(palette, argc, argv);

    // Log actions
    fossil_sanity_log_info("Command executed successfully.");

    // Clean up
    fossil_sanity_parser_free(palette);

    return 0;
}
```

### **Key Features in Action**

- **Validation:** Automatically ensures the correctness of input arguments.  
- **Command Parsing:** Quickly define commands with multiple argument types (e.g., strings, enums, booleans).  
- **Logging:** Output informative logs with customizable severity levels (e.g., info, warning, error).
